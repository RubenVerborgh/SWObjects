Hi, welcome to SWObjects and all that. You probably want to:
  Edit CONFIG to change which libs you link to.
  If you're using MacOS or non debian linux, edit the Makefile 
    to select the appropriate echo (e.g. ECHO:=`which echo`).
    There is some guidance in Makefile:33
  make test

This should all be made easier when ./configure if finished.
